# IISC Air Quality Analysis Project

Air Quality Analysis of multiple Indian cities using CPCB and NASA POWER data. It aims to understand pollutant trends, meteorological influences, seasonal patterns, and spatial variations.
 
##  Key Features

- **Pollutant Trends**: Analysis of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and Ozone levels across multiple cities.
- **Meteorological Influence**: Examination of how weather factors impact air quality.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Identification of seasonal variations in pollutant levels.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigation of relationships between different pollutants and meteorological variables.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualization of air quality data on maps with city markers.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Development of models to forecast air quality levels.

##  Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregated daily pollutant data from CPCB and NASA's POWER dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged datasets, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends, distributions, and correlations.
4. **Model Development**: Built predictive models to estimate future air quality levels.

##  Repository Structure
